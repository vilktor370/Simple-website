This is a self-made local version of https://msugrades.com/

With web_scraping.py you will be able to scrap class information you want from msugrades.com

With transform.py you can transfrom your restul into a excel file

With the plot.py you can draw your data from web_sccraping into bar chart.

P.S. You can get as many courses as you want for transform.py and web_scraping.py

Ex: "CSE" "3xx" will get your all the three hundred level cse classes

However, It is a very bad idea to draw all these data into 1 graph. Trust me 

I have tried and my computer is dead. Be carefull with that PART!!!!!
